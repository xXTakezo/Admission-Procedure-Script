# Admission-Procedure-Script
A sorting algorithm to automate university admission procedures

This script reads applicants from the list 'applicants.txt' and automates the selection process by sorting students by their GPA scores or alternatively their exam scores

Every department takes N-amount of students. If one department is full, the script will try the second and third priority department from each student.
